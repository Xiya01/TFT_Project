1. locate the folder where you have League of Legends
2. Inside a folder look for a config (default path -> C:\Riot Games\League of Legends\Config\)
3. using text editor open fie named 'game.cfg' 
4. set the resolution -> WindowMode=2, Height=800, Width=1280 and save the file
5. Execute code using interactive mode (-i) and write in terminal 'find_champion_shop()'
6. make sure, that you can see board with champions (champion shop) on your screen while writing 'find_champion_shop()'
7. That's all, thx
